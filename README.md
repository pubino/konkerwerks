# SAP Concur API & Browser Automation Test Suite

This project provides a unified Python integration client and test suite to verify connectivity and support programmatically creating draft expense reports in SAP Concur.

It supports two modes of interaction:
1. **API Integration (Direct)**: Uses SAP Concur REST APIs with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials authentication (requires API permissions and administrative licensing).
2. **Browser Automation (Playwright)**: Automates a browser session to perform UI clicks (useful if your organization doesn't have Web Services API access or if direct API keys are unavailable).

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### For API-Based Access
1. **Client Web Services License**: A valid license to enable API access.
2. **App Registration**: A registered application in the SAP Concur App Center to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
3. **Scopes**: Your application must have the `EXPRPT` (Expense Report) scope enabled.
4. **Target User Account**: A valid SAP Concur Login ID.

### For Browser-Based Automation
1. **Login Credentials**: Standard Concur username/password or SSO login.
2. **Playwright Setup**: Playwright must be installed locally along with chromium binaries (handled automatically by `./kkw setup`).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔍 Detailed Usage Examples & API Reference

### 1. Historical Expense Reports

Concur separates active draft reports from older, submitted, or processed reports via dropdown filters. The browser client automates navigating the reports grid, updating the view filter, and clicking individual cards to extract details.

* **List Old Reports:**
  ```bash
  # Query using the default 'Last 90 Days' filter
  ./kkw query-old
  
  # Specify a custom filter (e.g., 'All Reports')
  ./kkw query-old "All Reports"
  ```
  *Output Example:*
  ```text
  [SUCCESS] Discovered 2 historical report(s):
    1. Old Lodging Report 2025 (Purpose: FY2025 Conference)
    2. Q1 Travel Report (Purpose: Client Visits Q1)
  ```

* **Get Report Details:**
  ```bash
  # Get line items and header details for a specific report
  ./kkw report-details "Old Lodging Report 2025" "Last 90 Days"
  ```
  *Output Example:*
  ```text
  [SUCCESS] Details retrieved:
    Name:     Old Lodging Report 2025
    Number:   REP-100200
    Purpose:  FY2025 Conference
    Comment:  Approved & Paid
    Expenses: (2 items)
      - Date: 2026-06-12 | Type: Lodging | Amount: $150.00 | Merchant: Hilton
      - Date: 2026-06-13 | Type: Meal | Amount: $45.20 | Merchant: Italian Bistro
  ```

### 2. Credit Card Transactions

Automates listing and viewing credit card transactions inside the **Available Expenses** dashboard section. Supports selecting view activities such as "All Corporate and Personal Cards" or "All Purchasing Cards".

* **List Card Transactions:**
  ```bash
  # List corporate and personal cards (default)
  ./kkw list-cards "All Corporate and Personal Cards"
  
  # List purchasing cards
  ./kkw list-cards "All Purchasing Cards"
  ```
  *Output Example:*
  ```text
  [SUCCESS] Discovered 1 transaction(s):
    1. Office Depot - $189.99
  ```

* **Get Transaction Details:**
  ```bash
  ./kkw card-details "Office Depot" "All Purchasing Cards"
  ```
  *Output Example:*
  ```text
  [SUCCESS] Transaction details:
    Merchant:     Office Depot
    Date:         2026-06-18
    Amount:       $189.99
    Transaction ID: TX_5002
    Card Program: Purchasing Card
  ```

### 3. Expense Delegates Settings

Automates adding and removing delegates, plus managing permissions in the profile settings (`/profile/editdelegates.asp`).

* **Add Expense Delegate:**
  Add a delegate by name or email, specifying checkboxes for permissions (`prepare`, `submit`, `approve`).
  ```bash
  # Add John Doe with Prepare and Submit permissions
  ./kkw add-delegate "John Doe" prepare submit
  
  # Add Jane Smith with Prepare and Approve permissions
  ./kkw add-delegate "Jane Smith" prepare approve
  ```

* **Remove Expense Delegate:**
  Remove a delegate by selecting their checkbox, triggering 'Delete', and saving the profiles page.
  ```bash
  ./kkw remove-delegate "John Doe"
  ```

### 4. Month-End Expense Reconciliation

Reconciliation is a critical month-end task. The client navigates inside a report, reads the merchant list, and maps matching rules to fill in Expense Types, Business Purposes, Comments, and Allocation Codes for every transaction row. By default, it runs in **review-only mode** (leaving the report as a draft for your manual review). To automatically submit the report, pass the `--submit` flag.

* **Reconcile Report (Review-Only / Default):**
  ```bash
  # Reconcile using default built-in matching rules (does not submit)
  ./kkw reconcile "Reconciliation Report A"
  
  # Reconcile using custom rules (does not submit)
  ./kkw reconcile "Reconciliation Report A" my_recon_rules.json
  ```

* **Reconcile and Automatically Submit Report:**
  ```bash
  # Reconcile and submit immediately
  ./kkw reconcile "Reconciliation Report A" --submit
  
  # Reconcile using custom rules and submit
  ./kkw reconcile "Reconciliation Report A" my_recon_rules.json --submit
  ```
  
  *Example `my_recon_rules.json` file:*
  ```json
  {
    "Uber": {
      "expense_type": "Ground Transportation",
      "business_purpose": "Client travel to office",
      "comment": "Uber Ride",
      "allocation_code": "COST-CENTER-101"
    },
    "Office Depot": {
      "expense_type": "Office Supplies",
      "business_purpose": "Team whiteboard supplies",
      "comment": "Pens and notebooks",
      "allocation_code": "COST-CENTER-102"
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. Match & Attach Receipt Directly to Transaction

Matching receipt PDFs or images to individual card transactions can be automated. Playwright navigates into the expense report detail row matching your merchant name, locates the hidden file input element, and uploads the local file.

* **Attach Local Receipt to Report Expense:**
  ```bash
  ./kkw attach-receipt "Receipt Upload Report A" "Uber" "receipts/uber_ride_receipt.pdf"
  ```

## 🤖 Integration with Pi Coding Agent (pi.dev)

This project includes a project-local extension for the **Pi** coding agent (an open-source terminal-based AI coding assistant at [pi.dev](https://pi.dev)).

The extension is written in TypeScript and is saved at `.pi/extensions/concur.ts`. It registers custom tools that allow the Pi agent to interact directly with your SAP Concur session.

### Registered Tools

1. **`concur_list_reports(filter_view, is_old)`**: Queries and lists active or historical expense reports.
2. **`concur_report_details(report_name, filter_view)`**: Fetches line-item details of a report.
3. **`concur_list_card_transactions(filter_view)`**: Lists card transactions from Available Expenses.
4. **`concur_reconcile_report(report_name, rules, submit)`**: Automatically reconciles transactions using JSON rules, and optionally submits the report (default: `submit` is false, leaving it in draft mode for review).
5. **`concur_attach_receipt(report_name, merchant, receipt_path)`**: Uploads and attaches a local receipt file to an expense.
6. **`concur_create_report(name, purpose, comment)`**: Creates a new draft expense report headlessly.
7. **`concur_delete_report(report_name)`**: Deletes a draft expense report by name.
8. **`concur_card_transaction_details(merchant_or_id, filter_view)`**: Fetches details of a specific credit card transaction by merchant or ID.
9. **`concur_add_delegate(name_or_email, permissions)`**: Adds a new expense delegate in settings with specified permissions.
10. **`concur_remove_delegate(name_or_email)`**: Removes an expense delegate from settings by name or email.
11. **`concur_nuke_drafts_and_receipts()`**: Deletes all draft reports and available receipts inside Concur (intended for testing cleanup).
12. **`concur_check_session()`**: Checks whether the currently saved browser session state is active and valid (returns true if authenticated, false if expired or missing).

### How to Enable

If you use Pi within this repository, it will automatically discover the extension located in the `.pi/extensions/` folder. You can also manually load it or reload your active session by running `/reload` inside the Pi terminal client.

## 🔒 Handling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) & SSO in Browser Mode

Modern enterprise security often requires MFA or SSO login screens that standard automation cannot programmatically bypass. This project handles this using a **Session State Preservation** strategy:

1. Run the manual session setup:
   ```bash
   ./kkw login
   ```
2. A headed Chromium window will open. Enter your email/password, solve SSO if prompted, and complete the MFA authentication.
3. Once logged in and redirected to the SAP Concur dashboard page, return to your terminal and press **ENTER**.
4. Your authenticated session token, cookies, and local storage are saved into `concur_session.json`.
5. Subsequent automated actions will load this file and run headlessly without requiring login or prompt parameters.
